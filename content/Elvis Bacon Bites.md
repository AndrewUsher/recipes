## Ingredients

- 6 slices white bread
- 6 tablespoons peanut butter creamy or chunky
- 1 banana peeled and cut into 12 slices
- 12 slices bacon cut in half
- Oil for frying
- Honey (optional)
- 12 toothpicks

## Instructions
 
1. Heat oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. Using a sharp knife, cut the crust off the bread slices. Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter on one side of each of the 6 slices of bread.
1. Place 4 banana slices on each piece of bread. We'll be cutting each sandwich into quarters, so space the bananas accordingly. Place a second piece of bread,peanut butter side down, on top of the banana slices. Press gently to smush everything together. Cut the sandwich into 4 squares. Repeat with remaining bread and bananas.
1. Take one sandwich square, and wrap with a half slice of bacon. Place one end of the bacon on top of the sandwich and wrap it around, in one direction. Take another half slice of bacon, place the end on top, and wrap it around the sandwich in the opposite direction of the first bacon slice. Secure the second bacon slice end with a toothpick. Set aside and repeat with remaining sandwich squares.
1. Fry 3 to 4 bacon bites in the hot oil at a time for 1 to 2 mins, or until bacon is browned and crispy. Remove bacon bites to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining bacon bites, working in batches.
1. If you'd like, drizzle the bacon bites with honey before serving or dip them in honey as you eat. Serve warm.
